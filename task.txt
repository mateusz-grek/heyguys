    Task: Create a Simple Countdown Timer

    Your task is to create a simple countdown timer that counts down from a specified number of seconds - in this case 10 seconds
    but should be able to set different. The timer should display the remaining time on a webpage and update it every second.

    Layout: Figma
    URL: 
    


    Requirements:

    Create an HTML file with a <div> element to display the remaining time, and a button to start the timer.

    Create a JavaScript script that does the following:
    - When the button is clicked, initiate a countdown timer for 10 seconds using setTimeout.
    - Update the timer every second using setInterval.
    - Display the remaining time in the <div> element, and update it every second.
    - When the timer reaches 0, display a message indicating that the countdown has finished.
    - Provide a way to stop the timer before it reaches 0, for example, by clicking a "Stop" button.
    - Provide a way to increase (by another 10 seconds once its clicked) the timer, for example, by clicking a "Increase" button  (not longer than 60 seconds in total).
    - Style the webpage with CSS to make it visually appealing.

    Bonus: 
    - If time is reached - AJAX request to i.e specific file .json/.xml/.txt to get hidden content
